This repository contains electrical schematics and sample code to control a charlieplexed led matrix and some pushbutton switches using a teensy and micropython.

The parts in the electrical schematic are stored in [my eagle library repository](https://github.com/CatherineH/catherineh-eagle-libraries).

For more information on running the sample code, check out [my blog post on using micropython with the teensy](http://catherineh.github.io/programming/2016/09/18/getting-started-with-micropython-on-the-teensy).
